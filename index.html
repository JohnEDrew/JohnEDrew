        <h1>John Drew</h1>

        <p>Hello my name is John.</p>
        <p>I am currently in my fifth year at Michigan State University,expecting to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in Information Science with a minor in Data science in December of 2021.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>I am aspiring to find a career as a data scientist or data analyst.  The way that meaningful insight can be extracted from analyzing data has been interesting to me since first being introduced to the idea.</p>
		<p>Currently, I am profficient at the intermediate level in both Python and R studio, and I am very comfortable using Microsoft Office applications as well.  In the near future, I hope to learn how to use SQL and Tableau as I think it will be both interesting and a useful skill to have in the workforce.</p>
